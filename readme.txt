Month Days Identifier Program:

This C++ program was written as part of my learning journey to understand the basics of C++ programming. The program identifies the months corresponding to a given number of days.

Program Overview:

- Prompts the user to input the number of days in a month
- Uses a switch statement to match the input days with corresponding months
- Displays the months with the given number of days

Features:

- User input for number of days
- Switch statement for matching days with months
- Clear and informative output

How to Run the Program:

1. Copy the provided C++ code into a .cpp file
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
3. Run the compiled program:
    - On Linux/macOS: ./month_days
    - On Windows: month_days.exe
4. Enter the number of days when prompted

Learning Objectives:

- Understanding basic user input and output
- Using switch statements for multiple choice selection
- Working with integer variables and conditional statements
- Basic month-day identification logic
